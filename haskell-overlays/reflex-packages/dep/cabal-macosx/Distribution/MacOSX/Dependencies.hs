{- | Inclusion of bundle-local copies of libraries in application bundles.

OS X application bundles can include local copies of libraries and
frameworks (ie dependencies of the executable) which aids distribution
and eases installation.  Xcode and the traditional OS X development
toolchain support this fairly transparently; this module is an attempt
to provide similar functionality in the cabal-macosx package.

The basic approach is as follows:

  1. Discover the libraries an object file (executable, other binary, or
     library) references using @otool -L /path/@

  2. Copy those libraries into the application bundle, at the right
     place, ie @\@executable_path\/..\/Frameworks\/@ where
     @\@executable_path@ represents the path to the exeutable in the
     bundle.

  3. Modify the object file so it refers to the local copy, using
     @install_name_tool -change /oldLibPath/ /newLibPath/ /path/@ where
     @/newlibPath/@ points to @\@executable_path\/..\/Frameworks@ as
     described above (@\@executable_path@ is a special symbol recognised
     by the loader).

Complications:

  * There's some stuff we don't want to include because we can
  expect it to be present everywhere, eg the Cocoa framework; see
  /Exclusions/, below.

  * Libraries can themselves depend on other libraries; thus, we
  need to copy them in recursively.

  * Because of these transitive dependencies, dependencies can
  arise on multiple copies of the same library, in different
  locations (eg @\/usr\/lib\/libfoo@ and @\/opt\/local\/lib\/libfoo@).
  Thus, we preserve that path info, and (for example) copy
  @\/usr\/lib\/libFoo@ to
  @\@executable_path\/..\/Frameworks\/usr\/lib\/@.

The approach followed is to build a dependency graph, seeded with the
executable and any other binaries being included in the bundle, using
@otool@; then to walk that graph, copying in the libraries, and
calling @install_name_tool@ to update the dependencies of entities in
the bundle.  Going via a dependency graph is a bit unnecessary - we
could just recursively @otool@/@install_name_tool@, but its helpful if
we need to debug, etc., and a nice clear abstraction.

/Exclusions/: as described above, a lot of truly common stuff would
get copied in, so we provide a mechanism to exclude libraries from
this process: 'buildDependencyGraph' can be passed a list of strings,
and a library whose path includes any of those strings is excluded.
If an empty list is passed, then nothing is excluded (which is almost
certainly not what you want).
